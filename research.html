    <h1>About the research</h1>
    <p>Our research is about how cat's behaviour affects the stress levels of their owners.
    <br>Cats are known to reduce the stress levels of their owners. However, cats can also become a source of stress.
    <br>Our goal is to understand and measure how different behavioural patterns of cats affect their owners.
     <br>Or if there is any effects at all.
